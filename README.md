# 🎒 ZipForAI

**Easily prepare your code for sharing with an AI.**  
Automatically creates a clean `.zip` that excludes virtual environments, OS clutter, media, and more.

## 🧠 What It Does

You give it a folder.  
It creates a lightweight `.zip` that includes only what matters:
- Your scripts
- Config files
- Docs and notes

Everything else (like `venv/`, `__pycache__`, `.env`, `*.png`, etc.) is **skipped automatically**.

## ⚙️ How to Use (Windows CLI)

After downloading the `.exe`:

```bash
zipforai.exe "C:\Path\To\Your\Project"
